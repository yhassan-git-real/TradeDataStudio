# TradeData Studio Installation Guide

## System Requirements
- Windows 10 or later (64-bit recommended)
- .NET 8.0 Runtime (included in self-contained builds)
- SQL Server with appropriate permissions

## Installation Steps

### Option 1: Self-Contained Builds (Recommended)
1. Extract the appropriate archive for your system architecture:
   - `Windows-x64.zip` for 64-bit systems
   - `Windows-x86.zip` for 32-bit systems
2. Extract to a folder of your choice (e.g., `C:\Program Files\TradeDataStudio`)

### Option 2: Portable Build
1. Requires .NET 8.0 Runtime to be installed separately
2. Extract `Portable.zip` to any location

## Folder Structure
After extraction, you'll see the following structure:
```
TradeDataStudio/
├── config/                  # Configuration files
├── exports/                 # Exported data files
├── imports/                 # Imported data files
├── logs/                    # Application logs
├── TradeDataStudio.Desktop.exe  # Main application executable
